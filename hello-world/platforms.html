       <p>Steam is a video game digital distribution service and storefront developed by Valve Corporation. It was launched as a software client in September 2003 to provide game updates automatically for Valve's games, and expanded to distributing third-party titles in late 2005. Steam offers various features, like digital rights management (DRM), game server matchmaking with Valve Anti-Cheat measures, social networking, and game streaming services. Steam client's functions include game update automation, cloud storage for game progress, and community features such as direct messaging, in-game overlay functions and a virtual collectable marketplace.</p>

       <p>Origin was a digital distribution platform for macOS and formerly Windows, developed by Electronic Arts for purchasing and playing video games.

        In October 2022, Origin for Windows was discontinued, directing players to the EA App, with the macOS version remaining as the primary method for users to download and play EA games on that platform.[2]
        
        Origin contains social features such as profile management, networking with friends with chat and direct game joining along with an in-game overlay, streaming via Twitch and sharing of game library and community integration with networking sites like Facebook, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Nintendo Network,[3] and Nintendo Account. In 2011, Electronic Arts stated that it wanted Origin to match Valve's Steam service, Origin's primary competitor, by adding cloud game saves, auto-patching, achievements, and cross-platform releases.[4] By 2013, Origin had over 50 million registered users.[5]
